#+TITLE: README
* Requirement:

- flask, flask_wtf, flask_sqlalchemy, flask_migrate:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
pip install flask flask_wtf flask_sqlalchemy flask_migrate
  #+END_SRC

- Setting up database:
  #+BEGIN_SRC sh
export FLASK_APP=urlShortener.py
./setup.sh
  #+END_SRC

* Feature:
- Shorten long URL to short codes (generated or custom)

* Approach:
- Using SQLAlchemy to store data
- Models:
  + URL (store url, connect to multiple codes and entries)
  + Code (store short code)
  + Entry (store timestamp when accessing the url with the short code)
- codes, entries connect to URL with url_id = URL.id

* TODO 
- Analytics (Using entry to analyze daily and total access time)
- Refractoring (more descriptive name for variables and functions)
